# IoT-Based-Temperature-Humidity-Air-Quality-Monitoring-over-Adafruit

In this project, we are using the DHT22 sensor for sending Temperature and Humidity and MQ135 Gas Sensor for Air Quality data to Adafruit and ESP8266.
 By this method, we can monitor our DHT22 sensorâ€™s temperature and 
humidity data as well as MQ135 Gas Sensor for Air Quality over the internet using the Adafruit IoT server. And we 
can view the logged data and graph overtime on the Adafruit website.

#Components Required:

Node MCU ESP8266 
DHT22 Sensor
MQ135 Gas Sensor
Jumper Wires

#Software Used:
Arduino
